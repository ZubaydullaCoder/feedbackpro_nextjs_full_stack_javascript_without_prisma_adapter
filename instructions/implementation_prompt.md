USER PROMPT: Implement Phase 5

Objective: Implement all tasks outlined for Phase as detailed in the @instructions\gemini_instuctions\phase_5_detailed_plan.md.

Step 1: Project Familiarization & Contextual Understanding
Before writing any code, you MUST thoroughly review and understand the following:

1.  Core Project Documentation: All documents located in the @instructions\documents/ folder (including PRD, Project Architecture, and any other guiding documents).
2.  Overall Development Plan: The FeedbackPro_Development_Breakdown.md document, paying special attention to the detailed plan for the Phase: @instructions\gemini_instuctions\phase_5_detailed_plan.md.
3.  Previous Phase Summaries: Review all summaries in @instructions\phases_implementation_summary/ to understand the current state of the implemented application. (e.g., phase-3-implementation-summary.md).
4.  Current Workspace: Analyze the existing codebase structure and files to ensure consistency. (You may need to be provided with a file listing or specific files if you don't have direct workspace access).

_Once you have completed this review, confirm that you have assimilated the information and are ready for pre-implementation planning._

Step 2: Pre-Implementation Analysis & Plan Outline
Based on your understanding from Step 1 and the specific tasks for the Phase:

- Outline your intended changes BEFORE generating the full code.
- This outline should clearly list:
  - Files to be Created: (e.g., src/components/newFeature/NewComponent.tsx, src/services/newApiService.ts)
  - Files to be Updated: (e.g., src/app/page.tsx - section for new feature integration, src/utils/helpers.ts - adding new utility function)
  - Files to be Deleted (If any): (e.g., src/components/oldFeature/OldComponent.tsx)
  - Key Packages to be Utilized: (e.g., react, next, tailwindcss, shadcn/ui components like Button, Input, any specific data fetching libraries already in use)
  - New Packages to be Added (If absolutely necessary and not in plan): Specify package and justification.

_Present this outline for review. Await confirmation before proceeding to full implementation._

Step 3: Code Implementation (After Confirmation of Step 2)
Once the Pre-Implementation Analysis & Plan Outline (Step 2) is confirmed:

- Proceed to implement the tasks for the Phase.
- Generate the necessary code, create new files, and update existing files as per your outlined plan and the detailed tasks in FeedbackPro_Development_Breakdown.md.
- Ensure all code adheres to the principles defined in your System Prompt.
- If a task is large, you can break it down and implement sub-tasks sequentially, providing code for each.

Let's begin with Step 1. Please confirm once you have reviewed all specified documentation and are ready for Step 2.
